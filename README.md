# Image Classification Using Quantum Machine Learning

Welcome to the Image Classification Using Quantum Machine Learning repository! This project explores the integration of quantum computing techniques with traditional machine learning methods to enhance image classification tasks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how quantum machine learning (QML) can be applied to image classification problems. It leverages quantum algorithms to improve the performance and efficiency of image classification models. The repository contains code for implementing quantum machine learning models, including preprocessing of image data, training quantum models, and evaluating their performance.

## Features

- **Image Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preprocessing and preparing image data for quantum machine learning.
- **Quantum Models**: Implementations of quantum algorithms for image classification.
- **Classical Models**: Comparison of quantum models with classical machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating the performance of quantum and classical models.

## Technologies Used

- **Quantum Computing**: Utilizes quantum computing frameworks such as Qiskit for implementing quantum algorithms.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses libraries like scikit-learn for classical machine learning models.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for code implementation.
- **Image Processing**: Libraries like OpenCV or PIL for handling and processing image data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrathameshBamb/Image-Classification-Using-Quantum-Machine-Learning.git
cd Image-Classification-Using-Quantum-Machine-Learning
```
## Running the Code
- **Preprocess the Data:** Use the preprocessing scripts to prepare your image data.
- **Train the Models:** Run the training scripts to train both quantum and classical image classification models.
- **Evaluate the Models:** Use the evaluation scripts to assess the performance of trained models.

### Dataset

`Classification Using CNN.py` expects a directory structure with `ct` and `rt` folders containing 3D NIfTI files. Update the `data_path` variable at the bottom of the script to point to your dataset. If the folders or files cannot be found, the script now raises a clear error message indicating which directory is missing.
